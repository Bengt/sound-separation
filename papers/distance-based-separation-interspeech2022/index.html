  <p>We propose the novel task of <em>distance-based sound separation,</em> where sounds are separated based only on their distance from a single microphone.  In the context of assisted listening devices, proximity provides a simple criterion for sound selection in noisy environments that would allow the user to focus on sounds relevant to a local conversation.  We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by training a neural network to separate near sounds from far sounds in single channel synthetic reverberant mixtures, relative to a threshold distance defining the boundary between near and far.  With a single nearby speaker and four distant speakers, the model improves scale-invariant signal to noise ratio by 4.4 dB for near sounds and 6.8 dB for far sounds.

  <p class="section">Real data audio demo</p>
<p>This example was recorded with an iPhone in a room of size approximately 4m by 5m, with near speaker approximately 0.5m from the microphone and the far speaker approximately 2m from the microphone.  The example was processed by a model trained as described in the paper with training data source presence probability of 0.5.</p>
